# delayTimeCalculator
Reverb and delay create a sense of depth and width, adding a three-dimensional element to any mix or master. Knowing how to set the timing of your reverbs and delays can help you put a mix together faster and improve the sound of your mix. 

## Description

This reverb and delay calculator uses the basic principles how to Calculate Reverb and Delay Times. The calculation is quite simple, but a tool like this can help you visualize the delay times for each timing division in your project. For example, you will be able to see divisions from 1 bar all the way down to a 1/128 note including quarter notes, half notes, and the rest!.
To calculate delay times by hand, you just need to divide 60,000 by your BPM. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute (need reference), which equates to 60,000 milliseconds in one minute. Dividing this number by your BPM will, thus, give you the value of a quarter note in milliseconds.
